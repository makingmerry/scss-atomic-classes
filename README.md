## Features
- Lightweight and customisable.
- Shallow cascade (low specificity).
- Cohesive design system (scales can be utilised for specific properties e.g. font-size, margins, .etc).
- DRY and performant.
- Reusable across projects.

## Shortcomings
- Not an exhaustive list of properties, and properties are maintained manually (based on global and team standards).
- Hard to accommodate complex (e.g. nested) rulesets, best used as a first layer style tool, then paired with an object-oriented system to cover complex components.

## Getting Started
This library requires npm(https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
