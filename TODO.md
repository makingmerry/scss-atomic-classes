#TODO

- Explore HOC (higher order components) for rule-generators:
  - Should allow a param for negative rules (see how composition can be utilised).
- Explore implementing CSS grids:
  - Unsure how CSS grids are done yet, explore creating a simple layout initially.
  - Then explore if it can actually be made into a reusable pattern (otherwise leave it as a custom component-based style).
- Check and match currently supported properties with full list of CSS3 specifications:
  - Justify if properties are not included.
- Explore implementing a usable documentation:
  - Treat as side project for dashboard/UI library styling.
  - Explore if Kenneth is willing to take on the styling aspect of the documentation.
  - Prepare content for documentation.
- Allow for both step/scale generators and an optional list.
